# hello-world
My First Repository ('Welcome to Github!')

Hello everyone, my name is Albert; I'm a senior at The University of Georgia, and I'm excited to be on GitHub. My primary interests are Pure Mathematics and Data Science. I'm hoping to learn more about Neural Networks, Machine Learning and AI in general. Hope to be useful to the community!
